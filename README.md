## Repository files

Within this repository, we distribute a whole-body PBPK model of  Vancomycin, that has been developed using clinical studies in adults and evaluated for its predictive performance of CYP3A4 enzyme mediated clearance in children. 

The PK-Sim project file contains simulations of all published  clinical studies employed during model establishment and predictive simulations in pediatrics, including the respective observed data digitized.
